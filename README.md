# WalletHub
ASSIGNMENT #1: Please code a Java Selenium 2 code, which we can run on our end, that does this: 1. Login to Facebook. Username and Password should be on a variable we can change. 2. Post a status message "Hello World" ASSIGNMENT #2: Create a light user account in https://wallethub.com/join/light while unchecking the checkbox to get your free credit score and report. This is the account you should be using for this test. Then simulate the following actions: 1. Go to this URL: http://wallethub.com/profile/test_insurance_company/ 2. On the right part of the page, hover over the stars and click on the fourth star. Your code should actually (a) do the hover and (2) make sure the stars inside get lit up when you hover over them, then (3) click on the fifth star. Simply redirecting the WebDriver to the next page isn’t an option. 3. On the page you get redirected to, click on the Policy dropdown and change the value to “Health” 4. Click on the link “Write a review” and write some random text (minimum of 200 characters). 5. Press submit.
